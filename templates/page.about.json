Moreover, the blend components and the composition are curated with an eye towards seasonal availability and ease of access. The core idea behind our Single-Origin (“SO”) offerings is simply quality. The program is centered on seasonality and our best attempt to provide fresh-crop offerings as they become available and exhausted before they exhibit any characteristics of aging. The SO menu also provide various processing and varietal options to highlight the width and depth of flavors, regions, and farm-level inputs. The core driver of this part of the Night Swim Coffee menu is cupping Single-Origin offerings blind and choosing those coffees which elevate themselves above the rest in both quality and profile.<\/p>"
