Both of our blends, espresso and filter, base their composition on balance. Each blend serves a different purpose and is therefore balanced in a particular way. The selected blend components and the composition are curated with an eye towards seasonal availability and ease of access. Blended coffees, both at the farm level and roasting level, are essential for coffee's survival in the coming years. This is also why we center our menu around blends. We are excited and proud to share these coffees with the world, and find them to be really easy to enjoy and brew regardless of your taste preferences!  <\/p><p> <\/p>\n<p>The idea of our Single-Origin menu offerings is pretty simple. These selections allow us to showcase and share the particular coffees and coffee growers that excite us the most. This part of the menu is a perfect space to highlight various processing methods, fermentation techniques, coffee varieties, and flavor profiles. Single-Origin coffees are centered around seasonality. Just like any other agricultural product, fresh coffee is the best coffee, so we work with our importing partners to make sure our offerings are delicious and at peak freshness. <\/p>"
